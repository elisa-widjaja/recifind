In a stick blender jug add the eggs, flour, milk & salt. Blend until smooth and aerated. This can also be done in a stand up blender. Grate the parmesan, chop the herbs fine and mince the garlic. Transfer to a bowl. I like to add a pinch of salt to this mixture also. When youre ready to go, remove the pan from the oven and add the butter. Let it bubble and melt down completely. Then pour your batter mix into the pan. Scatter the cheese and herb mix over the top and return to the oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Do not open the oven during this time. To serve In a bowl mix the creme fraiche, chopped dill, lemon juice, lemon zest and salt. Arrange the smoked salmon in the bottom of the Dutch Baby and spoon over the dill creme fraiche. For the printable recipe go to eatlikeanadult.com and search Dutch baby. Or just Google eat like an adult smoked salmon Dutch baby."

Meanwhile, start with the base of  shakshuka a deep, fragrant sauce - by gently frying onions, garlic, and green chilli (seeds and all) in olive oil. Stir in cumin, paprika, and chili flakes, before adding tinned tomatoes and a good hit of seasoning. Simmer patiently until the sauce has slightly thickened,l and is full of flavor. Mix in the cooked aubergine. Once ready, create little wells in the sauce and crack in the eggs, seasoning them lightly with salt and pepper. Cover the pan and let the eggs cook to your liking, whether soft and runny or perfectly set. Finish with a generous scattering of parsley and coriander, a final drizzle of good olive oil, and serve with warm bread to scoop up every last bite. Enjoy!\"."

Tomatoes with garlic and thyme, roasted over whipped ricotta on a bed of crisp puff pastry finished with a sprinkling of fennel seeds. Easy to make and absolutely delicious. No need for a recipe here it couldnt be simpler! Just make sure you start the tart off in a hot oven at about 230 degrees centigrade - if you can preheat a baking stone or thick tray to put your tray on - that helps the bottom of the tart get crisp. Then when the pastry is golden turn the heat if needed so that it doesnt burn as it finishes cooking. Serve with rockety (arugala) green salad. Enjoy!\"."
